<div class="test"> Jeremy's Hobbies: Basketball, video games, math, running/tag, and singing. Brief Description: Basketball is a great sport I play, because I enjoy shooting the ball and the glory of winning a game. I do dribbling drills, shoot many shots, and make many layups a day to improve my basketball skills. In video games, I enjoy playing them. Games that I am good at with many players I can relate with (my friends) are the ones I play. For math rather than my other subjects in school, I am most pressured in that subject, therefore I am sure to be wary about math tests when I hit that obstacle. I learned Algebra 1 and many other math sections, to be prepared of what comes up in high school and college. I practiced running many days of my 6th grade middle school year, and because I practiced so much, I became proficient in running laps;therefore, I got better at other sports because of my stability along with basketball. Besides my running, exercising my vocal chords is good too, along with music that sets dopamine into my brain. I listen to music, then cover them with different runs of the song. My family can all agree I am quite vocal, especially when I sing where I would think no one could hear me. "I thought no one can hear me in my room."-Me, when my family member was listing all the times I sang loud. These are all my hobbies I do on a day-to-day basis, and I hope I can make them grow so then I, as an indiviual, can grow myself.

<div class="test4"> My favorite foods are ramen, steak, mac n' cheese, and  ice cream. They are foods that I would <b> prefer </b> to eat, therefore I would be a picky eater. My favorite color is blue, but colors that fit my personality are red and black. Red for hatred, or love; and black for darkness, or the desire for cold. My favorite game would be "One Night Ultimate Werewolf", "Supercell" games, or "Minecraft". My favorite subject in school would be P.E or math. My favorite music has a vast range of all types, but I would rather not share my favorite. My favorite outdoor activity is Capture the Flag, and my favorite indoor activity is hide and seek. My favorite tv show is Attack on Titan. My favorite type of book is scary and funny books, but I would rather read scary books in the daytime-I would think you would understand why. My favorite flavor of ice cream is vanilla, and my favorite piece of candy is Hershey's chocolate bars. Lastly, my favorite animals are cats-including tigers, leopards, or, under some circumstances, foxes-and dragons.

<h1> Section 3: Jeremy's School Career </h1>
<div class="test6"> Link to my Math sub-career: <a href="file:///Users/Jeremy/Desktop/Sublime%20Text%20~Folder/work2.html" target="_blank"> Here.</a> My school career is a system requiring many things I have learned along the years and clumping them together. For example, my preschool years were a bunch of happy moments with interacting with kids. Learning with others basic principles of basic daily lives and how to go to potty was a bit helpful. In Kindergarten when I was five, I decided to start gathering my thoughts about working with other people, and learning the rest of the alphabet. Afterwards from first grade to fifth grade, I learned the fundamentals of writing, the foundations of math, the history of events that began to go deeper in the events after each year, and the complicated sciences that made much sense. Every year was advancing, until I went to sixth grade. I had a large jump and learned many things much faster than I intended it to be. In sixth grade, I learned the different formats, different concepts, and new words that I had the option to use in my own writing, the more complicated math with variables, negative exponents, logarithms, complicated multiplication-but with variables and other concepts on the coordinate plane-, long division, and areas of abnormal objects like cones, major history events that happen from the B.C's but also minor ones as well; areas from around the world and their culture was learned at that time as learned as well, and science of energy, getting into the topic of physics as well. I also learned topics on the side; for example, Chinese, coding, more math, basketball, and running. My school career was two-thirds of my life so far, and I hope to learn even more in the future years of my life.

<div class="test7"> <div style="font-size:70px;"> Section 4: The End </div> <p> Thank you for coming to my website. If you came this far, you are probably the creator, presenting the website or I'm showing this to someone else. Anyways, thank you for sticking by! I hope to learn more in the future and sticking with my friends. Hopefully I can learn more Web Design and more programming languages to make more of these "awesome" websites for big companies! Probably not. Worth a shot though. </p>
